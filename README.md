# Foot Truck HTML Website

This is a website that I built using HTML/CSS for a peer at Middlebury College who was starting her own Mac&Cheese Truck company on campus. I wanted to challenge myself to tackle my first extracurricular project.

After finishing this project, I noticed a few things that did not seem ideal. First, I noticed I was repeating a lot of code. I wanted to write one piece of code for the navigation bar, for example, instead of copy and paste it into every html file. At the time I didn't know this, but I was looking for the solution of "components" which, after learning Javascript/React years later, would have helped me solve this problem.

Other duplicate code I noticed, say with selection of condiments in cater.html and order.html, felt imperfect to me at the time of this project. Now, I would move that functionality outside the html / view files and into a javascript one to handle the logic. 

I had not yet worked with databases before, so I never solved the "how do we store user information, etc" question. At the time, each order would simply submit a form and, say, email someone to handle orders on a case by case basis. 

There are some links to images that have been lost, and some general style issues with text overlapping. 

I also noticed that the project wasn't conducive to mobile views. This project, although rudimentary, highlighted some key insights into frontend development.

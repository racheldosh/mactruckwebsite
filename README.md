# racheldoshcollins.github.io

This is a mock website that I built from scratch for a peer at Middlebury College who was starting her own Mac&Cheese Truck on campus. I wanted to challenge myself to explore some new programming languages, and through this process I learned HTML/CSS (and some Javascript/mySQL).


Site currently hosted by github, found at racheldoshcollins.github.io

things to work on and improve:

make it possible that navigation bar/styling doesn't have to be written in each html/css file?

in cater.html and order.html, don't duplicate the code about selecting different condiments

play around more with the database, mySQL and php

general style of the site (some format errors, such as in the navigation bar when the screen in small, different links overlap)

fix google font?

mobile!

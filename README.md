test for website
mac truck, test 2


This is a mock website that I built from scratch for a peer at Middlebury College who was starting her own Mac&Cheese Truck on campus. I wanted to challenge myself to explore some new programming languages, and through this process I learned HTML/CSS (and some Javascript/mySQL).
